Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions

Our continuous goal is to provide you with the best user experience. We attach great importance to and protect your personal privacy. The latest EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which came into effect on May 25, 2018, has brought about changes including:

Instructions for use

1.0 BeatChecker is a non-medical product and cannot be used for medical purposes. It is not a clinical pulse oximeter. Although the measurement is relatively accurate, we have been continuously improving it over the years to make it more accurate and update the algorithm to meet your requirements. If you know that your pulse frequency is crucial to your health, you can further ask medical experts to measure your pulse.
